<img src="https://nilearn.github.io/_static/nilearn-logo.png" alt="nilearn" width="200"/>

This is an introductory tutorial for using [Nilearn](http://nilearn.github.io) to explore machine learning with neuroimaging data.
It was developed for use at the [Montreal AI and Neuroscience (MAIN)](http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/2018/MAIN2018/index_e.php) conference in December 2018.

It is rendered here using [Jupyter Book](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book),
with compute infrastructure provided by the [Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform (CONP)](http://conp.ca).
